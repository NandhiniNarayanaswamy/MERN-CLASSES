📘 What is DOM?
---------------
 The DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript is a programming interface for web documents. 
 It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects, allowing you to access and manipulate HTML and CSS content dynamically using JavaScript.
🔍 In Simple Words:
DOM is a way for JavaScript to interact with the content, structure, and style of a webpage.

🧱 Structure of the DOM
************************
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
The DOM represents this as a tree:
Document
 └── html
     ├── head
     │   └── title
     └── body
         ├── h1
         └── p

Change content (innerHTML)
Change styles (style)
Handle events (onclick, addEventListener)
Create or remove elements (createElement, removeChild)
