    in browser html creats a dom tree - js access the dom tree
-- How  js access DOM
 -- By using js how to create a element that is tag + content
 difference b/w innerText and innerHTML
 -- learn how to style the element
 -- how to create nested div, how to create attributes,

📘 What is DOM?
---------------

 The DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript is a programming interface for web documents. 
 When a webpage is loaded, the browser takes the HTML code and turns it into a tree-like structure (like a family tree).
This structure is called the DOM.
JavaScript can then interact with this DOM to read, change, add, or delete elements on the page.

🔍 In Simple Words:
DOM is a way for JavaScript to interact with the content, structure, and style of a webpage.

🧱 Structure of the DOM
************************
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
The DOM represents this as a tree:
Document
 └── html
     ├── head
     │   └── title
     └── body
         ├── h1
         └── p
✋ Why DOM is Important?
It allows you to:
Change content (innerHTML)
Change styles (style)
Handle events (onclick, addEventListener)
Create or remove elements (createElement, removeChild)
JavaScript uses the DOM to control webpages dynamically.
🔄 What does "dynamic" mean here?

Static means fixed, does not change after the page is loaded.

Dynamic means the content, style, or structure of the webpage can change while the page is still open, without reloading it.
⚡ Real-world examples of dynamic changes
A live clock updating every second on a webpage.
A shopping cart total changing when you add/remove items.
A “Like” button on Instagram turning red immediately when you click it.

📌 Real World Example
When you click a “Like” button on Facebook:
The DOM gets updated to show a blue thumbs-up icon.
JavaScript modifies the element in the DOM without reloading the whole page.

✅ In short:

The DOM is like a bridge between HTML and JavaScript.
HTML creates the content, DOM organizes it into a tree, and JavaScript can change that tree anytime

🌐 Where can you find the DOM?

The DOM is not a file you can open.
It’s a live object model created by the browser from your HTML page.

You can see and interact with the DOM in the browser’s Developer Tool
🛠 How to see the DOM?
Open any webpage (even Google.com).
Right-click → Inspect (or press F12 / Ctrl+Shift+I).
Go to the Elements tab.
Here, you’ll see the DOM tree (which looks like your HTML).
This is not just static HTML — it’s the live DOM the browser is using.
👉 If JavaScript changes the page (like changing text, adding/removing elements), you’ll see those changes reflected in the DOM, even though the original HTML file hasn’t changed.

🖼 Example
Suppose your HTML is:
<p id="msg">Hello World</p>
If you run in the console:
document.getElementById("msg").textContent = "Welcome!";
In the Elements tab, the <p> will now show:
<p id="msg">Welcome!</p>
But if you open the page source (Ctrl+U), it still shows:
<p id="msg">Hello World</p>
page source = original HTML file,
while DOM = live, updated version in the browser’s memory.

🖼 Example 1: Real world

Object: Car
Properties:
color = "red"
model = "BMW"
speed = 120

In JS:
let car = {
  color: "red",
  model: "BMW",
  speed: 120
};

console.log(car.color);  // "red"
console.log(car.speed);  // 120

Here:
car is an object.
color, model, speed are its properties.
🖼 Example 2: DOM element

When you select a DOM element:

let div4 = document.getElementById("div4");

because document is the global object so it is stored in div4 so it is also object
div4 is an object (representing the <div>).

It has many properties:

div4.id → "div4"

div4.innerHTML → the HTML inside the div

div4.style → another object (for CSS styles)

div4.classList → another object (for CSS classes)

And when you do:

div4.style.backgroundColor = "lightblue";


style is a property of div4.

backgroundColor is a property of style.
