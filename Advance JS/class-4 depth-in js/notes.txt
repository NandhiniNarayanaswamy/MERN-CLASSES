🎯 synchronous:-
    It is going to execute code line by line and it will block the other operation untill current operation completes its execution.
🎯 Asyncronous:-
    non-blocking- It will not wait current operation completes its execution instead it will go for next operation.

🎯 foreach 
-------------
    The forEach loop is a built-in array method in JavaScript that lets you iterate over each item in an array and perform some action on it.

✅ Syntax:-
------------------------------------------------------
| array.forEach(function(element, index, array) {    |
|  // Do something with each element                 |
|    });                                             |
------------------------------------------------------                                             
element → current item in the array
index (optional) → index of the current item
array (optional) → the whole array

🧪 Example-
fruits.forEach(function(fruit) {
  console.log(fruit);
});

🧪  Example:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach(function(num) {
  console.log(num * 2);
});

 It is like map but difference is :-
🔁 forEach()
✅ Loops through each element in the array
❌ Does not return anything (always returns undefined)
✅ Used when you want to perform side effects (like printing, updating DOM, etc.)

🔁 map()
✅ Loops through each element
✅ Returns a new array
✅ Used when you want to transform the array

🎯 setTimeout
-----------------

setTimeout is a built-in JavaScript function that:
=> Waits for a specified time (in milliseconds)
=> Then executes a function

✅ syntax:
------------------------------------------------
| setTimeout(callbackFunction, delayTimeInMs); |
------------------------------------------------
=> The first parameter is a function (callback) that will be executed after the delay.
=> The second parameter is the delay in milliseconds.

🔍 Example:

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);

✅ Why is this a callback?
Because:
You're passing a function to another function (setTimeout)
And that function will be called back later — after the timer ends

even foreach is a callback function same as settimeout

🎯 callback()
--------------
A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked (called back) inside that outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
🔹 In Simple Terms:
A callback is a way to say:
"When you’re done with your job, call this function."

🎯 promise
------------
=>Promise in javascript is an Object that represents the evenatual completion or failure of an aync operation.
=>It allows us to handle async code more efficiently and we can use promise to avoid the callback hell
State of the promise....
1) Pending state -- The initial state, the operation is not yet completed
2) Fulfilled (resovled)... The operation completed successfully and the result is available
3) Rejected...The operation failed and error reason is available
🔚 Final Simplified Definition
A Promise is a JavaScript object that helps you deal with tasks that take time (like loading data), 
and lets you handle what to do when it succeeds or fails — all in a clean, organized way.
another defination:- 
A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous operation (something that takes time, like fetching data from an API or reading a file).
It is basically a "placeholder" for a value that you don’t know yet because the task is still running.
promise won't produce value, promise won't know what val will come by ding async task this gives resolve(success) or reject(failure) and .then will handle the success

syntax ..promsie is created using the Promise constructor.
handle by .then(),.catch(),.finally()
 here in promise resolve means
🔹 What is .then in JavaScript?
.then() is a method (function) available on Promise objects.

It's used to handle the result of a Promise when it is fulfilled (i.e., successful).

🔍 Why it matters?
When you do:

.then(...); // ← semicolon ends the chain here
.catch(...); // ← now this line is not connected to the Promise
JavaScript thinks they are two separate statements, not part of the same Promise chain.
//it gives catch needs try, need to put semicolon at last means in finally

🔍 What exactly does resolve() do?
✅ resolve(value) → tells JavaScript:
“This asynchronous task is complete successfully, and here is the value (data) I want to pass to the next .then().”
🔧 Example:
-------------------------------------------------------
| new Promise((resolve, reject) => {                  |
|  // do some task                                    |
|  resolve("Task done!");                             |
|  })                                                 |
|  .then(result => {                                  |
|   console.log(result);  // Output: Task done!       |
|   });                                               |
-------------------------------------------------------  
resolve(...) is used when the Promise is successful, move "task done" to the next .then()
It also sends a value (like an object or string) to the next .then()

i am not understanding this return?
Got it 👍 You’re stuck on the word return inside return new Promise(...).
Let’s slow down and think step by step.
🔎 Normal Function (no async)
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let result = add(2, 3);
console.log(result); // 5
Here, return means:
➡️ “Give this value back to whoever called me.”
🔎 Your Function (with Promise)
function choosefood(foodItem) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`Food chosen: ${foodItem}`);
      resolve({ food: foodItem, status: "chosen" });
    }, 1000);
  });
}

Here, return means:
➡️ “Give back a Promise object immediately to whoever called me.”

⚡ Important: The function does not give the food immediately. It gives a Promise that says:

“Wait a bit… I’ll either resolve with the food or reject with an error later.”
🔎 What happens when you call it?
let order = choosefood("Pizza");
console.log(order);
👉 Output:

Promise { <pending> }

Why?
Because right away, the function returns a Promise (not the food).
After 1 second, inside that Promise, the resolve(...) runs and fills the Promise with the value { food: "Pizza", status: "chosen" }.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

➡️ “Give back a Promise object immediately to whoever called me.” here who will call promise you mean choosefood()?
ChatGPT said:

Yes! 🎉 Exactly — the caller of choosefood() is the one who receives the Promise.

Let’s clear this with steps 👇

1️⃣ Who "calls" the function?

When you write:

choosefood("Pizza");


➡️ You are calling choosefood.

Now inside choosefood, you wrote:

return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { ... });


So what gets sent back to you (the caller)?
👉 A Promise object.

2️⃣ Example in action
let order = choosefood("Pizza");
console.log(order);


choosefood("Pizza") was called by you.

It returned a Promise object (because of return new Promise(...)).

So now order holds that Promise.

Output:

Promise { <pending> }

3️⃣ Who will "use" the Promise?

Now that you (the caller) have the Promise in order, you can use it like this:

order.then((res) => {
  console.log("Got the food:", res);
});

4️⃣ Full example
function choosefood(foodItem) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`Food chosen: ${foodItem}`);
      resolve({ food: foodItem, status: "chosen" });
    }, 1000);
  });
}

let order = choosefood("Pizza");  // YOU call the function
console.log(order);               // Immediately gives a Promise

order.then((res) => {             // YOU use the Promise later
  console.log("Got the food:", res);
});


✅ Output:

Promise { <pending> }   // immediately
Food chosen: Pizza      // after 1 second
Got the food: { food: "Pizza", status: "chosen" }  // after 1 second


👉 So when I said:

“Give back a Promise object immediately to whoever called me.”

I mean:

choosefood() is the function.

Whoever calls choosefood() (you, or another function) will immediately get a Promise object.

🎯 async and await
-------------------

🧠 What is async/await?
=> async and await are modern ways to write asynchronous code.
=> They make your code look like synchronous code, but it still runs asynchronously behind the scenes.
=> async/await is built on top of Promises.
🟢 async/await = cleaner, simpler way to use promises without chaining .then() over and over

🔍 What does async do?
=> When you put async before a function, it always returns a Promise.
=> Even if you return a normal value, it gets wrapped in a Promise.

🔍 What does await do?
=> await can only be used inside an async function.
=> It pauses the function until the Promise is resolved.
=> Then it returns the result, just like .then() would.

✅ When to Use async/await?
=> When you have multiple asynchronous steps to do in order
=> When you want to write cleaner and more readable code
=> When you want to avoid .then() chaining or callback hell

🧪 example:-
---------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  function step1() {                                                         |
|    return new Promise(res => setTimeout(() => res("Step 1 done"), 1000));   |
|  }                                                                          |
|                                                                             |
|  function step2() {                                                         |
|    return new Promise(res => setTimeout(() => res("Step 2 done"), 1000));   |
|  }                                                                          |  
|                                                                             |
|  async function runProcess() {                                              |    
|    const r1 = await step1();                                                |          
|    console.log(r1);                                                         |      
|                                                                             |          
|    const r2 = await step2();                                                |  
|    console.log(r2);                                                         |  
|  }                                                                          |
|                                                                             |
|  runProcess();                                                              |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔍 Explanation:
step1 is a normal function that returns a Promise.
setTimeout(...) simulates a 1-second delay.
After 1 second, it resolves (successfully completes) with the string "Step 1 done"

async function runProcess() 
-------------------------------

🔍 Explanation:
You declare an async function named runProcess().
This allows you to use await inside it.

const r1 = await step1();
---------------------------

🔍 Explanation:
You call step1() and use await to pause until the Promise is resolved.
The result "Step 1 done" is stored in variable r1.


✅ await vs .then(): What's the Difference?
They do the same thing, but in different styles.

🔁 With .then():
*********************************************************
step1().then(result => {
  console.log(result); // Step 1 done
});
*********************************************************
# step1() returns a Promise
# .then() waits for it to resolve
# When it resolves, the result is passed to the callback

🧠 With await:
***************************************
const r1 = await step1();
console.log(r1);  // Step 1 done
***************************************
# step1() is called immediately
# await pauses the current function (runProcess()) until the promise resolves
# When resolved, the value is stored in r1
# Then it moves to the next line (console.log(r1))
