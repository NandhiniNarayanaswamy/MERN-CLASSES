function getuser(id) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.log("GOT USER ID:", id);
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve({ id: id, name: "nandhu" })
    }, 2000);
  })
}

console.log(getuser(1));
🔍 What happens step by step

Call getuser(1)

Enters the function.

new Promise(...)

Creates a new Promise object immediately.

Runs the executor function (resolve, reject) => { ... }.

Inside executor

console.log("GOT USER ID:", id) runs instantly (synchronous).

setTimeout(...) is scheduled for 2 seconds later → but it doesn’t block anything (async).

The executor finishes.

Return

At this moment, the Promise object is returned right away.

Its state = pending (because we haven’t called resolve yet).

That’s why console.log(getuser(1)) prints Promise { <pending> }.

After 2 seconds

The callback inside setTimeout runs.

resolve({ id: id, name: "nandhu" }) is called.

Now the Promise changes from pending → fulfilled.

✅ So the answer

No ❌ — JavaScript does not wait for 2 seconds to return the Promise.

It returns the Promise immediately, with state = pending.

The setTimeout runs separately in the background.

After 2 seconds, the Promise settles (fulfilled).


------------------------------------------------async & await--------------------------------------------

In JavaScript, `async` and `await` are used to handle asynchronous code in a way that makes it easier to read and understand, compared to using `Promises` with `.then()` and `.catch()`.
The `async` keyword is used to define a function that always returns a **Promise**. This makes it possible to use the `await` keyword inside it to pause execution of the function until a Promise is resolved or rejected.

- An `async` function always returns a **Promise**, even if it doesn’t explicitly return one.
- If an `async` function returns a non-Promise value (like a string, number, object, etc.), it is automatically wrapped in a resolved Promise.
The `await` keyword can only be used **inside an `async` function**. It pauses the execution of the `async` function until the **Promise** passed to it is settled (either resolved or rejected).

- When you use `await`, it waits for the Promise to resolve and returns the resolved value.
- If the Promise is rejected, an error is thrown, and you can catch it using `try`/`catch`.

### How `async` and `await` Work Together
-----------------------------------------------
- The `async` function is used to define a function that will return a **Promise**.
- The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the `async` function and wait for a **Promise** to resolve.
- This makes it much easier to handle asynchronous operations without needing to manually chain `.then()` and `.catch()`.
