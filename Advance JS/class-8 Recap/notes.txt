🔍 What is localStorage?
localStorage is a built-in JavaScript object provided by the browser.
It lets you store data in key-value pairs on the user's browser.
The data stays even if the user closes or refreshes the browser.

🔍 What does setItem() do?
setItem(key, value) is a method that saves data to localStorage.
It takes two arguments:
key: a name to identify the data (like a label)
value: the actual data you want to store

✅ What is DOMContentLoaded?
DOMContentLoaded is a special event in JavaScript.
It is fired by the browser when the HTML page is fully loaded (but before images, stylesheets, etc. finish loading).

🔍 Where does it come from?
It is part of the Web API provided by the browser, not JavaScript itself.
You can use it on the document object — which represents the entire webpage.

✅ Full line:
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    // your code here
});

💡 What it means:
"Hey browser, when the HTML has finished loading, run this function."

So the code inside the function will only run after the HTML is ready.

✅ Why is it used?
Let’s say you have this code:

document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", doSomething);
If you write this before the HTML <button id="myButton">Click</button> is loaded, it will give an error because the element doesn't exist yet.

🔹 .toggle("dark-mode")
=> 🌞 -> This adds the class "dark-mode" if it’s not already there. (OR)
=> 🌙 -> it removes the class "dark-mode" if it is already there.
