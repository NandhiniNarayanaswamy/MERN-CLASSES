🚀 Redux
***********
=> Redux is a state management library commonly used in React applications to manage 
and share data across components in a predictable way.

=> Redux helps you store your application's data (state) in one central place (store) 
so that any component can access or update that data without complicated prop drilling.

this is the folder structure we created
src
 ├── App.js
 ├── index.js
 ├── components
 │    └── Counter.js
 ├── redux
 │    ├── counterActions.js
 │    ├── counterReducer.js
 │    └── store.js
 ├── App.css
 └── index.css

Now...
understand the Analogy
🌟 Imagine Redux as a “Central Diary” for Your Application
Think of your app like a big house with many rooms (components).
🏠 Rooms = React Components
Like:
Login page
Dashboard
Cart
Navbar
etc.
📖 Problem
Each room needs some common information. Example:
Is the user logged in?
How many items are in the cart?
What is the user’s name?
If every room tries to send messages to every other room → complete confusion, too many props, too many state updates.
So we need ONE COMMON PLACE to store shared data.
⭐ Redux = One Central Diary (Store)
Just imagine there is one diary kept in the living room, and all rooms can:
Read from the diary
Write updates to the diary (but using a defined process)
This diary = Redux Store
🤔 So Why Do We Need a Store?
Because without the diary:
Every room keeps its own small piece of info
Rooms don’t know updates from other rooms
App becomes messy
Bugs appear
Data becomes INCONSISTENT
With the store:
All important data stays in one place
Every component sees the same data
Your app stays clean and predictable
⭐ Next: How Does the Diary Get Updated?
Imagine:
You don’t directly write in the diary.
Instead:
You write a request slip
(“Add one item to cart”)
→ This is called an Action
A manager reads your slip and updates the diary
→ The manager is called the Reducer
Diary changes → everyone in the house knows the new info
→ Components automatically re-render

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is App.js file
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import Counter from './components/Counter';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
        <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here see v have imported counter means it same as counter code is in App.js, so we go to counter.js

Counter.js
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import { increment, decrement } from "../redux/counterActions";
import { useSelector, useDispatch} from "react-redux"


function Counter() {
    // useSelector access the state from the redux store
    const count = useSelector((state) => state.count)

    // useDispatch dispatches actions to the redux store
    const dispatch = useDispatch();



    return(
        <div>
            <h1>Counter App</h1>
            <h2>Count value is: {count}</h2>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>increment</button> 
            <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>decrement</button>
        </div>
    )
}

export default Counter
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                |
                                                v
Here when user clicks increment button dispatch function vl go to action.js and return dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })

action.js
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Action creater for incrementing the count value
export const increment = () => {
    return {type: "INCREMENT"}
}



// Action creater for incrementing the count value
export const decrement = () => {
    return {type: "DECREMENT"}
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So dispatch is sending the action object to Redux store.

Your store has the reducer:

const store = createStore(counterReducer);

So Redux will send the dispatched action to your reducer:

counterReducer(currentState, action)

store.js
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// import createStore to create the redux store
import {createStore} from "redux";

// import the counter reducer
import counterReducer from "./counterReducer";

// create the redux store and we are going pass the reducer
const store = createStore(counterReducer);  //calls the reducer function

export default store
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Store updates the state
The store automatically:

saves the new state

notifies React

React re-renders any component using useSelector.

useSelector gets the updated state
const count = useSelector((state) => state.count)


After reducer updates count, useSelector receives new value.

UI becomes updated automatically.


*********************************************************************************
Click Button
   ↓
dispatch(increment())
   ↓
increment() → {type: "INCREMENT"}
   ↓
Store receives action
   ↓
Store sends action to reducer
   ↓
Reducer runs:
    if INCREMENT → count + 1
    if DECREMENT → count - 1
   ↓
Reducer returns updated state
   ↓
Store updates state
   ↓
useSelector gets the new state
   ↓
UI updates automatically
