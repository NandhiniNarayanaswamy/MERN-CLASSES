🧐 why we need to put in flower bracket { name } ?
🧠 1. What actually happens in React
When you write this:
<Child name="nandhu" />
React internally passes props like this:
{
  name: "nandhu"
}
So the Child component receives one object called props, which contains all the data (props) sent by the parent.
✅ Two ways to receive props:
🔹 Way 1: Using props directly (classic way)
function Child(props) {
  return <p>Hello {props.name}</p>;
}
Here, you receive the full object, then use props.name
🔹 Way 2: Destructuring props (cleaner)
function Child({ name }) {
  return <p>Hello {name}</p>;
}
In this case, you're saying:

“Take the name property out of the props object and create a local variable called name.”

That’s what this line does:
function Child({ name }) {...}
it's called destructuring.

❓ Why does React show this error?
🧩 Problem: Rendering an Object in JSX
const obj = { name: "Nandhini", age: 25 };

return <div>{obj}</div>;
This will give you this React error:

❌ “Objects are not valid as a React child.”
React can only render these values inside JSX:
| Type                        | Renderable? | Example                          |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| ✅ String                    | Yes         | `"Hello"` → Hello                |
| ✅ Number                    | Yes         | `25` → 25                        |
| ✅ JSX                       | Yes         | `<h1>Hello</h1>`                 |
| ✅ Array of renderable items | Yes         | `["A", "B"]` → AB                |
| ❌ Object                    | ❌ No        | `{ name: "Nandhini" }` → ❌ ERROR |
✅ Solution: Use JSON.stringify(obj)
This function converts a JavaScript object into a string (so that React can render it).
🔍 Example:
const obj = { name: "Nandhini", age: 25 };

return <div>{JSON.stringify(obj)}</div>;
🔸 Output in browser:

{"name":"Nandhini","age":25}
📌 What is JSON.stringify()?
It's a JavaScript method that:

Converts an object or array into a string in JSON format

Useful for debugging or showing raw data

Prop drilling
----------------
Prop drilling in React refers to the process of passing data (props) from a parent component down to deeply nested child components,
 even if intermediate components don't need that data themselves — they just pass it along.

❌ Why Prop Drilling is a Problem:
It clutters code, especially when many components are involved.

Makes components tightly coupled.

Makes refactoring and maintenance more difficult.

Intermediate components may be forced to have props they don’t use.

⚛️ child to parent component
-----------------------------
🧠 First, understand the basics of data flow in React:
Parent to Child: Easy! You pass data via props.
Child to Parent: You cannot directly send data from child to parent. Instead, you use a function.
📤 Child to Parent Communication
In React, child-to-parent communication means sending data from a child component to a parent component.
✅ How do we do that?
You pass a function from parent to child via props. Then, the child calls that function and sends data to it.
