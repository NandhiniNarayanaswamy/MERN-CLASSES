🌳 1. What is <Outlet />?

<Outlet /> is a placeholder component provided by React Router.

It tells React Router “render the child route’s component here”.

Without <Outlet />, child routes (like your BoyBabyWear, GirlBabyWear, Toys) will never show up inside their parent (KidsWear).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. General meaning of placeholder

A placeholder is something that “reserves a spot” where content will appear later.
Example:

In a form, <input placeholder="Enter name" /> → it shows Enter name until you type something.

It doesn’t do anything itself, but it marks a spot where something else (text, component, route, etc.) can appear.

2. <Outlet /> as a placeholder

In React Router:

<Outlet /> is like saying:
“At this exact spot, show whichever child route matches.”

It doesn’t render anything by itself.
Instead, React Router fills that “hole” with the child component.

/ inside the kidswear?
----------------------
1. Your Parent Route
<Route path="/kidsWear" element={<KidsWear />}>
   {/* children go here */}
</Route>
This means:
/kidsWear → show KidsWear component.

Now, inside this parent, you want to add child routes like BoyBabyWear.

2. Child Route with Absolute Path
<Route path="/boyBabyWear" element={<BoyBabyWear />} />
Because it starts with /, React Router treats it as root-level path, not part of kidsWear.

So this will match only when URL is /boyBabyWear.
⚠️ Notice → it’s NOT connected to /kidsWear at all, even though you nested it in code.

3. Child Route with Relative Path
<Route path="boyBabyWear" element={<BoyBabyWear />} />


No / → React Router treats it as relative to the parent (/kidsWear).

So this becomes /kidsWear/boyBabyWear.

4. Side-by-Side Comparison

If you put them both:

<Route path="/kidsWear" element={<KidsWear />}>
   <Route path="/boyBabyWear" element={<BoyBabyWear />} />   {/* absolute */}
   <Route path="girlBabyWear" element={<GirlBabyWear />} />  {/* relative */}
</Route>


You’d get:

/boyBabyWear → shows BoyBabyWear (root-level, not inside kidsWear).

/kidsWear/girlBabyWear → shows GirlBabyWear (nested under kidsWear).

5. Real-World Analogy

Think of a file system 📂:

C:/Documents = parent folder

If you write C:/Photos (absolute path), it goes directly to the root drive, not inside Documents.

If you write just Photos (relative path), it means C:/Documents/Photos.

React Router paths work the same way ✅

React Router v6, nested child routes are supposed to be written with relative paths (no /). else you get error.
