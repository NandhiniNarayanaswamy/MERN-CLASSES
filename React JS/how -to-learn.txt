if you are learning any topic in language?
follow this pattern for learning:
1. what is useState()?
2. how to use UseState()?
3. when to use UseState()?
4. what problem does it solves?
these much is enough don't go in depth beacuse you going to work in industry where it will keeep on updating 
the concept which u learn today may not be used tomorrow they need to grow. so just follow this pattern.
If you catch yourself going too deep, ask:
“Will this help me explain it or use it in a project soon?”
If yes → continue.
If not → note it in a “Learn Later” list. (You can revisit it later out of curiosity.)


don't change your character for learning deep.  just know to stop where you want
you are not researching here in industry you are building
for research you can in deep.
