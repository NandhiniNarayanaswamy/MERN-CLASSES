🟢 Arrow Function Syntax

An arrow function can be written in two main ways:
1. Without {} → Implicit Return
If you don’t use {}, the expression after => is returned automatically.
city1.map((city) => (
  <li>{city}</li>
));

Here:

(city) => (<li>{city}</li>)
means return <li>{city}</li> automatically.

2. With {} → Explicit Return Needed

If you use {}, you must explicitly write return.
Because {} means function body, not an object or JSX directly.

city1.map((city) => {
  return <li>{city}</li>;  where it will return? it returns to the map function
});

✅ This works because we told it to return.
🚨 Why Error Happens?
If you write:
city1.map((city) => { <li>{city}</li> });
JavaScript thinks { ... } is a function body.
Inside, you wrote <li>{city}</li> but never returned it.
So it returns undefined → React shows nothing (or error if strict).
